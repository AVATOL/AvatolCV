At ORIENTATION step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_orientation.txt file

runConfig_orientation.txt has these lines:
    imagesToOrientDir,<points to where segmented files were put>   ---->> was   darwinOutputDir,<same as in xml file - points to where segmented files are put>
    relaventImagesFile,<path to file that lists pathnames of images to orient>
    orientationResultsDir,<path to dir to put orientation normalized images>
    ___create document that specifies apexLocationConvention = left, so that if someone wants to 
    outputFileSuffix=_oriented.jpg
	
relaventImagesFile will have entries that are the root names of images in the darwinOutputDir

step 1 rotation
(no other inputs - only the image list)
result files of this step are  named like this:
leaf1_rotatedMask.jpg
leaf1_rotatedOrig.jpg


step 2 orient
over hundred images with training - maybe 20 minutes

result files of this step are  named like this:
leaf1<???>_Mask.jpg
leaf1<???>.jpg      <--- this will be passed in

csv file for annotation 
each row represents leaf with its annotation

pre-shipped label annotation file
<somepath>/<someleaf>_rotatedMask.jpg, orientation-annotation (0 or 1)               // ground truth label for svm
