At ORIENTATION step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_orientation.txt file

AvatolCV knows to generate these lines:
    inputImagesDir=<path to output dir of segmentation>
    orientationOutputDir = '/Users/jedirvine/av/avatol_cv/modules/orientation/yaoOrient/orientationOutput';
 
AvatolCV generates these two lines and the associated files due to inputRequired lines in algProperties file:
    testImagesFile=<somePath>/testImagesFile.txt
    testImagesMaskFile=<somePath>/testImagesMaskFile.txt
    
AvatolCV generates these two lines and the associated files due to dependency lines in algProperties file:
    pathLibSsvmMatlab=<modulesPath>/3rdParty/libsvm/libsvm-318/matlab
    pathVlfeat=<modulesPath>/3rdParty/vlfeat/vlfeat-0.9.20/toolbox/v1_setup
    


step 1 rotation

step 2 orient
over hundred images with training - maybe 20 minutes
