Conventions:
1. normally full pathnames are passed in data files.  Let's make an exception here as these files will be more likely to be read by humans for debugging and full pathnames will clutter them up
2. image filenames will be of the form <imageId>_<origImageName>.jpg   Since the imageID is imbedded in the name, no need to pass it in and out of algorithm
3. for Morphobank data passed to scoring algorithm, characters and their values are "typed" and appear as a compound string:  

    <scoringConcernType>:<scoringConcernId>|<scoringConcernName>
    
    An example, the scoringConcern is:       character:1824347|Upper I1 presence
                the scoringConcern Value is: characterState:4884322|I1 present
                
   I will pass this full string  
   
4. Comment lines start with # and can be ignored by the algorithm

DATA RETURNED FROM ALGORITHM (placed into scoringOutputDir)
    
    one or more files of the following form:
    
    scores_<scoringConcernType>_<scoringConcernID>_<scoringConcernName>.txt contains 
    
        imageDir=<someDir>
		scoringConcernType=<someType>
		scoringConcernID=<someID>
		scoringConcernName=<someName>
        scoringConcernValues=<val1>,<val2>,<val3>...
        #imageName,scoringConcernValue,pointCoordinates,confVal1,confVal2,confVal3...
        <image1Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,<pointCoords>,<confVal1>,<confVal2>,<confVal3>...
        ...
        
    if there are no point coordinates returned, it would be 
    
        imageDir=<someDir>
		scoringConcernType=<someType>
		scoringConcernID=<someID>
		scoringConcernName=<someName>
        scoringConcernValues=<val1>,<val2>,<val3>...
        #imageName,scoringConcernValue,pointCoordinates,confVal1,confVal2,confVal3...
        <image1Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,,<confVal1>,<confVal2>,<confVal3>...

Point Coordinates 
+ delimits the annotations in the series
: delimits type from points  
; delimits the points in the annotation
| delimits x and y coordinates  (prefered comma but that has meaning already on the rest of the line
  

example:
rectangle:25|45;35|87+point:98|92
