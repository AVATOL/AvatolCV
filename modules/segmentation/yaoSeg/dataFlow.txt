# overwrite trainlist.txt with trainlistShipped.txt, and add any files referenced in trainingImagesFile, which will most likely be empty (no segmentation training files locally produced at this time)
#

# by this time we have our combined trainlist.txt file for the alg to use


#
#
# reformat contents of testingImagesFile to correct form, by converting the pathname to a filename and extracting the root 
# and putting into testlist.txt for use by algorithm
#

# by this time we have our testlist.txt file



#  Make it so that all the testing and training images are in one dir...
#
# copy the session-provided testing images (specified in testingImagesFile) to the just-cleaned allImages dir
# (we will not be testing the shipped test images so don't copy those)
#
# then copy the shipped training images from data/training_imgs to allImages
#
# then copy the session-provided training images (trainingImagesFile) to ALL_IMAGES_DIR
#
#


#
#
# pool the shipped ground truth images from data/allLabels and the session-provided ground truth label images (groundTruthImagesFile which will be empty) to allLables
