At SCORING step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_scoring.txt file

runConfig_scoring.txt has these lines, and others that can be ignored:
    imagesToScoreDir, <path of images to score>  ---->>>  was   orientationResultsDir,<path to dir where orientation normalized images are>
    trainingImagesFile,<path to training images file>  // file will be named trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
    testingImagesFile,<path to testing images file>    // file will be named testingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
    scoring_resultsFile,<pathname of file into which scoring algorithm will put results> // file will be named results_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
	___??? avatolCV shouldn't know about notion of apex.  How handle this ?   --->>>  apexLocationConvention,left
    
trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt have entries that are the root names of images, followed by character state name

results_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt , to be created by SCORING step, has form identical to trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt

    DATA PASSED TO ALGORITHM
runConfigScoring.txt contains:

    OBSOLETE -> inputImagesDir=<somedir> // this is the orientationOutput dir which has cropped,rotated orig image and mask image
	testImagesFile=<somepath1> // the file referenced lists the full pathnames of files that are the cropped orig ones
	testImagesMaskFile=<somepath2> // the file referenced lists the full pathnames of files that are the masks
	scoringOutputDir=<someOutputDir> // where to put output
    trainingDataDir=<dirWithTrainingData> // see below *
    
NOTE - presence of testImageFile and testImagesMaskFile keys and values will be driven by these lines in the algProperties file
# this next line will cause avatolCV to create an entry in the runConfigScoring file that will have the key of testImagesFile, and the value will be a pathname to a file that contains pathnames of image files that contain the string "alignOrig"
inputRequired=alignOrig:testImagesFile
# this next line will cause avatolCV to create an entry in the runConfigScoring file that will have the key of testImagesMaskFile, and the value will be a pathname to a file that contains pathnames of image files that contain the string "alignMask"
inputRequired=alignMask:testImagesMaskFile

    
* dirWithTrainingData contains one or more files that contain training data information:
    
    
    training_<scoringConcernType>_<scoringConcernID>_<scoringConcernName>.txt   // scoring concern info is in the filename
    
        imageDir=<someDir>
		scoringConcernType=<someType>
		scoringConcernID=<someID>
		scoringConcernName=<someName>
        
        (optional) trainingTestConcernName=<someName>  ___add trainingTestValue (optional) somehow
        #imageName,scoringConcernValue,pointCoordinates
        <image1Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,<pointCoords>
        <image2Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,<pointCoords>
        ...
    
if there are no pointCoordinates in play, the file will look like
    
        imageDir=<someDir>
		scoringConcernType=<someType>
		scoringConcernID=<someID>
		scoringConcernName=<someName>
        #imageName,scoringConcernValue,pointCoordinates
        <image1Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,
        <image2Name>,<scoringConcernValue>,
        ...
    
if there is no scoringConcernType, then the filename will look like:   training__<scoringConcernID>_<scoringConcernName>.txt (note consec undercores)
