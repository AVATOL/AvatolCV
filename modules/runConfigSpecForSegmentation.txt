At the SEGMENTATION step, avatolCV will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_segmentation.txt file

runConfigSegmentation.txt has lines of the following form:

    # the following three files contain absolute pathnames
    trainingImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/trainingImagesFile.txt  
    groundTruthImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/groundTruthImagesFile.txt
    testingImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/testingImagesFile.txt
    
	segmentationOutputDir=<path of dir where output goes>
	avatolCVStatusFile=<path to file to write status to> (avatolCV will poll that file)
