At the SEGMENTATION step, avatolCV will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_segmentation.txt file

runConfigSegmentation.txt has lines of the following form:

    
    trainImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/trainImagesFile.txt  (absolute pathnames) 
    testImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/testImagesFile.txt
    
	segmentationOutputDir=<path of dir where output goes>
	avatolCVStatusFile=<path to file to write status to> (avatolCV will poll that file)

AvatolCV generates this line and the associated files entries(if any) due to inputOptional line in algProperties file:
    userProvidedGroundTruthImagesFile=<someAbsolutePath>/userProvidedGroundTruthImagesFile.txt
