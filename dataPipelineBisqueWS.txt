avatolCV will invoke leaf algorithm code three times


1. to run segmentation
2. to run orientation
3. to run scoring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the SEGMENTATION step, avatolCV will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_segmentation.txt file

runConfig_segmentation.txt has lines of the following form:

    //___delete this one --->>> darwinXMLFileDir,<path to dir containing darwin xml file>
    trainingImagesFile=<path to training images file>  // file will be named trainingImages_segmentation.txt
    testingImagesFile=<path to testing images file>    // file will be named testingImages_segmentation.txt
    rawImagesDir=<path of dir where right sized images from bisque are put>
    trainingImagesDir=<path of dir where _groundtruth training examples can be found>
	segmentationOutputDir=<path of dir where output goes>
	//___delete this one ---->>  modelXmlPath,<path to generated model that will be used during test>

    trainingFileSuffix=_groundtruth.jpg // was seg training files ..._groundtruth.jpg
	outputFileSuffix=_mask.jpg  // was output files       ..._mask.jpg
	 

lines with other prefixes that can be ignored by leaf code:
    trainingImage,...
    testImage,...


trainingImages_segmentation.txt and testingImages_segmentation.txt have entries that are the root names of images
    path=<some_dir>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At ORIENTATION step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_orientation.txt file

runConfig_orientation.txt has these lines:
    imagesToOrientDir,<points to where segmented files were put>   ---->> was   darwinOutputDir,<same as in xml file - points to where segmented files are put>
    ___do we need this???  -->>> rawImagesDir,<path of dir where right sized images from bisque are put>
    relaventImagesFile,<path to file that lists filenames of images to orient>
    orientationResultsDir,<path to dir to put orientation normalized images>
	___avatolCV shouldn't know about this -->>  modelFilePath,<path to pre-trained svm model for apex, base locating>
	___??? avatolCV shouldn't know about notion of apex.  How handle this ?   --->>>  apexLocationConvention,left

    outputFileSuffix=_oriented.jpg
	
relaventImagesFile will have entries that are the root names of images in the darwinOutputDir

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At SCORING step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_scoring.txt file

runConfig_scoring.txt has these lines, and others that can be ignored:
    imagesToScoreDir, <path of images to score>  ---->>>  was   orientationResultsDir,<path to dir where orientation normalized images are>
    trainingImagesFile,<path to training images file>  // file will be named trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
    testingImagesFile,<path to testing images file>    // file will be named testingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
    scoring_resultsFile,<pathname of file into which scoring algorithm will put results> // file will be named results_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
	___??? avatolCV shouldn't know about notion of apex.  How handle this ?   --->>>  apexLocationConvention,left
    
trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt have entries that are the root names of images, followed by character state name
    00-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz,charStateName 
    03-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc,charStateName
    
testingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt 
    04-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz
    10-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc
    
results_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt , to be created by SCORING step, has form identical to trainingImages_scoring_<charId>_<charName>.txt
    04-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz,charStateName 
    10-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc,charStateName   ___what about training/test discriminator???
