The matrix_downloads folder is where you will download zip files from Morphobank.

- Create a subdirectory under matrix_downloads with the same root name as the zip file.
- move the zip file into this new directory
- unzip the file there
- (optionally) delete the zip file

The application will then be able to find your matrix data.
