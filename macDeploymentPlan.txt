I compiled the matlabScriptInvoker into a project called invoke

This created an invoker dir which had a distrib dir. This woud have been packaged into an installer.


To get it to run, I created a mac_start script that looks like 



#!/bin/bash 
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80/runtime/maci64:/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80/sys/os/maci64:/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80/runtime/bin/maci64:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/JavaVM:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Libraries"

export XAPPLRESDIR="/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80/X11/app-defaults" 
./run_invoker.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v80 "$@"


The critical piece is that it has the location of the installed MCR as the first arg. Then the remaining args are passed through.  run_invoker was generated by the build.

Here's the plan:
