avatolCV will invoke leaf algorithm code three times


1. to run segmentation
2. to run orientation
3. to run scoring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the SEGMENTATION step, avatolCV will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_segmentation.txt file

runConfig_segmentation.txt has lines of the following form:

    darwinXMLFileDir,<path to dir containing darwin xml file>
    trainingImagesFile,<path to training images file>  // file will be named trainingImages_segmentation.txt
    testingImagesFile,<path to testing images file>    // file will be named testingImages_segmentation.txt
    rawImagesDir,<path of dir where right sized images from bisque are put>

lines with other prefixes that can be ignored by leaf code:
    darwinOutputDir,<same as in xml file - points to where segmented files are put>
    trainingImage,...
    testImage,...


trainingImages_segmentation.txt and testingImages_segmentation.txt have entries that are the root names of images

    03-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At ORIENTATION step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_orientation.txt file

runConfig_orientation.txt has these lines:
    darwinOutputDir,<same as in xml file - points to where segmented files are put>
    rawImagesDir,<path of dir where right sized images from bisque are put>
    relaventImagesFile,<path to file that lists filenames of images to orient>
    orientationResultsDir,<path to dir to put orientation normalized images>


relaventImagesFile will have entries that are the root names of images in the darwinOutputDir

    03-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc
 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At SCORING step, I will pass one argument, which is the path to the runConfig_scoring.txt file

runConfig_scoring.txt has these lines, and others that can be ignored:
    orientationResultsDir,<path to dir where orientation normalized images are>
    trainingImagesFile,<path to training images file>  // file will be named trainingImages_scoring.txt
    testingImagesFile,<path to testing images file>    // file will be named testingImages_scoring.txt
    scoring_resultsFile,<pathname of file into which scoring algorithm will put results>
    
trainingImages_scoring.txt have entries that are the root names of images, followed by annotation values
    00-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz,some_annotation_value 
    03-uietIOuerto5foKMhUHYUh_imgAbc,some_annotation_value

    04-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz

results_scoring.txt has form identical to trainingImages_scoring.txt
    04-5xayvrdPC3o5foKMpLbZ5H_imgXyz,some_annotation_value
