This release is the first drop for Andrea for running AvatolCV on Windows 10.

It includes just the java code, the docs and modulesOSU.

Known issues:
  - numerous minor bugs and issues, but onle one worth mentioning relevant to Morphobank datasets
  - Uploading scores is still broken pending Morphobank fix from Maria.
